# Git me Amadeus!
This is a script intended to take some of the drudgery out of a common git add/commit/push to a master branch on github. If you're going to use this, please remember to alias gitmebaby so you can use it as follows: gitmebaby "Did some work on the readme".

Also note, this readme was in fact pushed to github using gitmebaby. I used it to update itself. Very meta. So syntax. Much Ruby.
